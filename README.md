# WinterProject22

Webapplication to provide crowdsourced information about a coffeeshop's current capacity. 

Issue this will solve: Google maps provides current capacity based on number of phones currently in coffee shop. Sometimes those people are just in line to by coffee and they will leave quickly. Other times, google will mark coffee shop as empty/ but all tables are taken by 1 or 2 people, appearing to google that the coffee shop is empty. With our application we will provide more accurate information provided by actual people. 

Features:
1. Will save from driving to coffeshop to find it is full.
2. Simple to use.
3. Provide accurate information when data is freshly input.
4. Receive points that a user can save for coffee.
5. Incentive to providing data will be that after certain points a user can receive enough to convert to a coffee.


Example Use Case:
1. User enters a coffeeshop.
2. User gets ping from the application to provide how many free tables are available.
3. User inputs information for specific coffee shop.
4. User receives points.
